# Create shopping cart with React & Redux

You should create a cart page for online shop, please treat it as a part of a big application, so it should be well documented and maintainable. Your code should be uploaded on Github and your application should be available through a link (for example deployed to Github Pages).

## Functionality

1. Load cart items on cart page load (use any API mock services or just .json file)
2. Each cart item should contain:
   - Name
   - Price
   - Quantity
3. Each cart item should have quantity switcher (+/-)
4. Cart items should have the ability to be deleted from the list
5. Your cart page should have a form for adding new cart item, the item should be added to the top of cart items list on form submit

## UI/UX

Design is totally up to you, the only requirement - don't use ready design systems, we would like to examine your CSS/HTML skills, we'll also pay attention to accessibility.

## Tests

We write tests for all our production code, that is why we ask you to cover at least one of modules in your test app with tests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
